Steganography is the art and science of hiding information within other data in such a way that the existence of the hidden information is concealed. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on keeping the contents of a message secret, steganography aims to hide the fact that a message is being sent at all. 

In digital steganography, this typically involves embedding secret data within multimedia files like images, audio, or video. The hidden information is often imperceptible to human senses, making it difficult to detect without specialized tools or knowledge of its existence.

One common technique in digital steganography is LSB (Least Significant Bit) insertion, where the least significant bits of the pixels in an image or the samples in audio are altered to encode the hidden data. Since these alterations are often subtle, the original media's visual or auditory quality remains largely unchanged.

Another approach is to exploit redundant or unused space within a file format to store the hidden information. For example, the metadata of an image file might contain enough unused space to embed a hidden message without visibly altering the image itself.

Steganography has numerous applications, ranging from covert communication and digital watermarking to copyright protection and tamper detection. However, its effectiveness relies on both the complexity of the technique used and the ability to securely transmit the key or method needed to extract the hidden information. As digital forensic tools and techniques advance, steganography methods must continually evolve to remain effective.
